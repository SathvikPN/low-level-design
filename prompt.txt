Project Goal
Design and implement a flexible, maintainable system that demonstrates mastery of low-level design principles, SOLID principles, and common design patterns.
Context
Low-level design (LLD) focuses on the actual implementation details of a system: classes, methods, relationships, and interactions. Unlike high-level system design which deals with architecture and components, LLD is about translating those architectural decisions into actual code that follows best practices.

Core Learning Objectives

1.Apply all SOLID principles consistently
2. Implement appropriate design patterns for specific problems
3. Create maintainable, testable, and extensible code
4. Practice proper abstraction and separation of concerns
5. Design clean interfaces and class hierarchies

Language to be used:

Java

Output:
Code the whole logic into a single file with proper comments
