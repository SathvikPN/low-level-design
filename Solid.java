class Solid {
    // S: Single Responsibility Principle - A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. 
    // O: Open/Closed Principle - Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification
    // L: Liskov Substitution Principle - If a class S extends or implements class T, then you should be able to use S anywhere T is expected—without breaking the program’s behavior or logic
    // I: Interface Segregation Principle - Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use
    // D: Dependency Inversion Principle - business logic should depend on shared interfaces and not tight-bound to implmentations
